    "On this assignment we are going to address a critical challenge that being the enhancement of building / apartment's energy efficiency by utilising data driven insights. By employing the dataset of the govermental website we aim to analyse , model & predict energy efficiency ratings with end goal to generate recommendations that stakeholders / tenants can adopt to improve energy performance & reduce enviromental impact where possible collectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The significance of the issue : Energy efficiency on domestic EPC's is fundamental for reaching target goals for : sustainability / diminishing energy consumption & mitigate climate change. Residential along with commercial buildings make for a big part of total energy usage & carbon emissions. If we succesfully establish the key factors which influence the energy performance we would then be able to identify, implement targeted upgrades for energy efficiency & promoting caution - minimize enviromental pollution. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to carry out the work and the analysis needed for the assignment we extracted a whole dataset for the domestic EPC's of the Barnet authority via the  [\"Energy Performance of Buildings Data: England and Wales\" : https://epc.opendatacommunities.org/domestic/search?address=&postcode=&local-authority=E09000017&constituency=&uprn=&from-month=1&from-year=2008&to-month=12&to-year=2024 ] it contains over 173000 records addressing : building characacteristics / energy ratings & consumption patterns. Although the dataset is great and covers extensively the data needed accross all key areas some limitation was noted : some incomplete data on key fields like energy ratings / building characteristics that can potentially 'skew' the analysis & results of our models. Some data entry errors (duplicate entries / outliers) which could also potentially 'skew' the whole result reliability. The representation of certain property types and energy rankings is limited (as of what reflects to what exists on Barnet) which can potentially result in bias in feature importace or modelling. \n",
    "The dataset also spans from 2008 all the way to 2024 and throughout this years building regulations, energy efficiency standarts , available technologies have been reshaped and evolved overall potentially making this variability may affect energy ratings / consumption patterns as older assestments may not properly compare with newer ones due to changes of criteria and evaluation methodology differences. \n",
    "The dataset does not include external factors as energy tariffs / other financial incentives or climate conditions to mention. All of those factors will be considered and reviewed during the proccessing of the dataset on the  cleansing / transforming stage\n",
    "\n",
    " Throughout this comprehensive analysis we are going to : Clean and transform the dataset for accuracy , Conduct exploratory / diagnostic analytics to find patterns / relationships in the data , develop predictive models in order to forecast the ratings of energy efficiency , identify critical features that influence the energy performance .\n",
    "We will conclude with the evidence based generated reccomendations that will indicate the ideal economic - energy efficient approaches that will enhance the stakeholders / tenants efforts to achieve sustainability & minimized carbon footprint.\n"
